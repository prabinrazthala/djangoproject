STATIC and MEDIA

1. In every web app, a developer encounters these terms "media" and "static"
2. While both of these look similar to assets (photos, videos, css, js etc), there is slight difference
   between them
3. Static are the fixed assets in an application (eg. logo, css, js)
   whereas, media are the user uploads (profile picture, video files)
