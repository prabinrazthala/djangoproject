1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping
2. It is the way of querying the database without having to write raw SQL Queries
3. Rather we can directly write python code to query the database
4. Django has default support for ORM. We donot need to install extra package for this service.


Let's see basic CRUD ORMs

Read
    1. If "ClassRoom" is the name of the model
        =>ClassRoom.objects.all() this query is equivalent to "SELECT" * FROM ClassRoom
        #filter
        classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address="KTM")
        #multiple filter
        classrooms = Classroom.objects.filter(address="KTM", name="Ten")

        #get

        classroom = ClassRoom.objects.get(name="One")
        =>get() method should always be used with unique attributes like username, email,id,phone etc.
        =>There are two types of errors associated with get() methods
            =>MultipleObjectsReturned: It is raised when get() is used with data occuring multiple times
                in a table
            => DoesNotExist: It is raised when get() is used with data not present in the table
            =>While using get() method always keep it inside try...except block

            Note: filter() method doesn't raise above errors


2. Create
    #First Method
    ClassRoom.bojects.create(name="One",address="KTM")
    #Second Method
    ClassRoom(name="two",address="KTM")
